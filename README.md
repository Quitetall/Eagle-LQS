## Dependencies

Eagle depends on **[LamQuant-Lossless](https://github.com/Quitetall/LamQuant-Lossless)** (the codec under test). It is a **standalone** clone; no sibling layout required. The Rust bench crates pull `lamquant-firmware` directly over a pinned git-rev, so Eagle resolves on its own.

```bash
git clone git@github.com:Quitetall/Eagle.git
cd Eagle

# Python tools — install the codec wheel from LamQuant-Lossless
pip install "lamquant-codec @ git+https://github.com/Quitetall/LamQuant-Lossless.git#subdirectory=reference_implementations/python_codec"
pip install -e .

# Rust hazard3_bench (riscv32 firmware target)
cd tools/hazard3_bench && cargo build --target riscv32imac-unknown-none-elf

# Rust host benches
cd ../bench/bench_rs && cargo build
```

Both `tools/hazard3_bench/Cargo.toml` and `tools/bench/bench_rs/Cargo.toml` reference `lamquant-firmware` via a pinned git-rev:

```toml
lamquant-firmware = { git = "https://github.com/Quitetall/LamQuant-Lossless.git", rev = "abcae4794c38b3d3e75d3c214063cf0307e3daba", default-features = false }
```

Pulling a specific rev keeps the bench numbers reproducible against an exact codec commit. Bump the `rev` to re-pin against a newer LamQuant-Lossless release.

## How to reproduce paper numbers

```bash
# 1. Bench a corpus (CHB-MIT shown; substitute path as needed)
python3 tools/bench_chbmit.py --corpus /path/to/chbmit --out evidence/

# 2. (Optional) bench TUEG subsets — requires 1.76 TB local mirror
python3 tools/bench_tueg_subsets.py --corpus /path/to/tueg --out evidence/

# 3. (Optional) Verilator RTL bench for RP2350 cycle count
cd tools/hazard3_bench && bash run_bench.sh verilator

# 4. Verify every paper claim against evidence JSON
python3 tools/verify_paper_claims.py
# Expected: 60 PASS / 0 FAIL when evidence/ is fully populated
```

## Two modes — external LQS vs internal LamQuant dev

Eagle's test/bench suite runs in two clearly-namespaced modes:

**External — the LamQuant Standard (LQS).** Default. Codec-agnostic: the
vendor-neutral **LQS** standard (its own repo, [Quitetall/LQS](https://github.com/Quitetall/LQS),
consumed here by the `eagle` crate) plus the agnostic Python suites treat any
conforming codec as an opaque compress/decompress box and verify only
externally-observable quantities (compression ratio, bit-exact round-trip,
latency, EDF parity). These run without the neural/torch stack and are what
external CI executes:

```bash
pytest -m "not internal"     # external LQS Python suite
cargo test -p eagle          # the eagle crate (pulls the sibling LQS standard)
```

**Internal — LamQuant vendor dev.** LamQuant-specific introspection
benchmarks that reach inside the neural codec internals (FSQ entropy/activity,
latent utilization, Cayley rotation, residual-FSQ, subband leakage, TNN memory,
XNOR/cpop MACs, C-vs-Python parity, ablation matrix). They are a dev dependency
of LamQuant, **not** part of the external standard; they require the sibling
**LamQuant-Neural** source tree plus the **LamQuant-Lossless** wheel, stay in
Python, and are gated behind the `internal` pytest marker so they are skipped
by default. See [`tests/internal/README.md`](tests/internal/README.md).

```bash
pip install -e '.[neural]'   # sibling neural + lossless stack
pytest -m internal           # internal LamQuant dev suite
```

The introspection benches physically remain under `tests/benchmarks/`; they are
tagged, not moved.

**BCI downstream concordance (codec-agnostic, lives fully in Eagle).**
`tools/bench_moabb_concordance.py` is the motor-imagery parallel to the NEURAL
seizure-detection concordance: it asks *"does a codec preserve downstream BCI
decoding accuracy?"* by running compress→decompress→decode→compare with a
CSP+LDA pipeline and reporting the accuracy/kappa deltas. It is **codec-agnostic**
— the codec is an opaque box reached through the `lml` binary (resolved from
`$LML_BIN` → sibling `../LamQuant-Lossless/target/{release,debug}/lml` → `$PATH`),
so it stays in the external LQS tier and does not depend on the neural stack
(unlike the seizure module, which lives in sibling LamQuant-Neural and is
`importorskip("ai_models")`-gated). The synthetic offline core needs only
`numpy + mne + sklearn + pyedflib + the lml binary`; real motor-imagery datasets
(BNCI2014_001, etc.) need the **moabb extra** (`pip install -e '.[moabb]'`) and
are gated behind the `data` / `slow` markers. Be honest about what it proves: for
a **lossless** codec Δ = 0 is *trivial-by-bit-exactness* (the round-trip is the
identity at the sample level), so a `test_lossy_roundtrip_is_detected` guard
proves the metric is not a self-fooling always-pass. The bench earns its keep
when the neural / lossy codec ships and the deltas can actually move.

```bash
# offline core — codec-transparent on the real lml binary, no moabb:
LML_BIN=/path/to/lml pytest -m bci tests/validation/test_moabb_concordance.py
LML_BIN=/path/to/lml python3 tools/bench_moabb_concordance.py --source synthetic

# real motor-imagery data:
pip install -e '.[moabb]'
python3 tools/bench_moabb_concordance.py --source moabb \
    --dataset BNCI2014_001 --paradigm LeftRightImagery --subject 1
```

## Architecture

Eagle is one repo in an 8-product Unix decomposition of LamQuant. It depends on **LamQuant-Lossless** (codec library) and optionally on **LamQuant-Neural** (when the neural codec ships) via Cargo feature flags.

| Public | Private (for now) |
|---|---|
| LamQuant-Lossless (codec under test) | LamQuant (monorepo source of truth) |
| **Eagle** (this repo — validation) | LamQuant-Neural (SNN/TNN models) |
| LamQuant-Firmware (planned formal split) | LamQuant-Codec (turnkey integration) |
| BLUT (training orchestrator) | |
| LamQuant-Vision (LSL + viz) | |

## Rust fast gate (eagle crate + sibling LQS)

The vendor-neutral **LQS** standard is its own crate ([Quitetall/LQS](https://github.com/Quitetall/LQS),
Rust-canonical for fast CI / pre-commit feedback). Eagle's `eagle` crate
consumes it via a sibling-clone path dep — clone LQS next to this repo:

```
parent/
  LQS/      (github.com/Quitetall/LQS)
  Eagle/    (this repo)
```

CI runs the `eagle-rust` job (sibling-checkout LQS, then `cargo build -p eagle`
+ `cargo test -p eagle`). To run the same gate locally before every push,
enable the bundled hook:

```bash
chmod +x scripts/lqs-fastgate.sh .githooks/pre-push
git config core.hooksPath .githooks   # enables .githooks/pre-push (Rust fast gate)
```

`scripts/lqs-fastgate.sh` (`cargo build -q -p eagle && cargo test -q -p eagle`)
is the fast local mirror of the CI `eagle-rust` job; run it standalone anytime.
